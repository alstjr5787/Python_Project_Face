# Python_Project_Face

This program uses MTCNN to detect faces and employs a Keras-trained face recognition model to identify each face. It detects faces in uploaded images and automatically applies a mosaic effect, while also providing face detection functionality through a real-time webcam.

### TECHNOLOGY USED:

1. **Tkinter ** - Used for the entire graphical user interface.
2. **OpenCV ** - Used for handling image processing and webcam functionality.
3. **MTCNN ** -Utilized for face detection in images.
3. **Keras  ** -Utilized for data exchange between the application and the server.
